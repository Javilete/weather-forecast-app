# weather-forecast-app
Weather forecast app is a web app implemented using reactjs after taking a react training course. This app uses the openweathermap API to gather the data and display it using different react components.
Also, the web app is deployed into firebase and can be accessed at goo.gl/GvShnB

Improvements to be done:
- Add menu with favourites cities (on going)
